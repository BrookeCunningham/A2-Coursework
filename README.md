A2 Coursework for CCEA Software Systems Development A-Level - A database driven solution using SQL Server local database.

This project utilised C# and SQL and was developed in Visual Studio using Microsoft Forms. It implemented the following :
1. A relational database consisting of 8 tables.
2. Stored procedures to protect from SQL injection.
3. OOP approach including 12 classes.
4. A Data Access Layer class corresponding to each relation in the database.
5. Validation on all user input.
6. Reports generated to display the data.
7. 220 page report documenting the development process

This solution was created based on a case study which encouraged us to make a booking system for glamping pods.
My application allowed users to add, manipulate, view and delete bookings from the database.

This coursework was a fantastic opportunity to delve into project management alongside database management, the project management is detailed in depth in my report.
In the future I would focus more on the user interface as i underestimated the importance of the visual componant, a different framework would be helpful for more creative freedom.
